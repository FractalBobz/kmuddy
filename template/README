This directory contains the template for a KMuddy plug-in.

To use it, copy all the files to a new directory, rename files as necessary,
then edit the files and change file/class names.

All occurences of kmuddyplugintemplate must be renamed to the same string, and
the same holds for KMuddyPluginTemplate.

If your plug-in is a part of KMuddy's tree, add it to plugins/CMakeLists
to the directories list, then run make in the plugins directory.
