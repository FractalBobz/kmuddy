TODO file for the libMXP library
--------------------------------
- <HIGH> tag should use something more sophisticated to compute the new color

MXP features that are not implemented in the library:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Response for <VERSION> tag doesn't support sending of STYLE and REGISTERED
  information
- <!TAG> is not supported, because Zugg has added this to the spec after
  I've gotten my copy, he didn't announce it anywhere nor did he update
  the timestamp of the MXP document (!) - hence, <!tag> is not supported atm
- QUIET parameter for the <relocate> tag is not supported; also, <relocate>
  does not have a closing tag in this implementation
- <support> with parameters is not supported

Some of these features might be implemented in the future (if I see the
    need for them).
